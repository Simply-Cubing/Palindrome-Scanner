# Palindrome-Checker
Check if a word is spelled the same way forwards and backwards! Only valid words in the english dictionary will work so names like ‘bob’ and ‘hannah’ will unfortunately not work. I plan to add a feature that scans a block of text for palindromes but school is annoying at the moment lol.
